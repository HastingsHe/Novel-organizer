    <!-- Section: Characters -->
    <div class="section" id="characters">

        <h3 id="kathy">Kathy</h3>
        <p><strong>Key traits:</strong> Kathy, the protagonist and narrator, is introspective, empathetic, and reflective. She is a carer later in life, and her memories of Hailsham shape her perception of the world.</p>
        <p><strong>Quote:</strong> "I was a student at Hailsham. You must have heard of it. Everyone has. It was a school like no other" (Chapter 1). Kathy's description of Hailsham highlights her perspective on the place and its significance.</p>

        <h3 id="tommy">Tommy</h3>
        <p><strong>Key traits:</strong> Tommy is passionate, emotional, and prone to outbursts. His character represents the struggle of understanding one’s purpose and the frustration of being unable to control his life.</p>
        <p><strong>Quote:</strong> “Tommy was angry, always angry... But he also had a tenderness to him, a vulnerability that made him so real” (Chapter 2). This reflects Tommy's complexity as a character who is both fiery and emotionally fragile.</p>

        <h3 id="ruth">Ruth</h3>
        <p><strong>Key traits:</strong> Ruth is manipulative, insecure, and often tries to control situations. She has a deep, sometimes misguided, love for Tommy and often competes with Kathy.</p>

        <h2>Themes</h2>
        
        <h3>Memory and Identity</h3>
        <p>The novel explores the role of memory in shaping identity, particularly through Kathy’s reflective narration. She constantly revisits her memories of Hailsham, trying to make sense of her past and coming to terms with the truth of her life’s purpose.</p>
        <p><strong>Quote:</strong> “The memories I have of Hailsham are so clear. It was there, in that place, that I realized... I would never have what I thought I would” (Chapter 3). Kathy’s thoughts underscore how memories define who we are and how our understanding of the past shapes our present.</p>

        <h3>Mortality and Ethics of Science</h3>
        <p>The ethical dilemma surrounding organ donation and the existence of human clones is central to the story. The characters face the inescapable reality of their purpose and the morality of their creation. These issues are explored through the lives of Kathy, Tommy, and Ruth, who slowly come to realize the implications of their futures.</p>
        <p><strong>Quote:</strong> “The reason I’m telling you this is because it’s all part of what we are... it’s how we were made” (Chapter 4). This quote reflects the realization that their entire existence has been predetermined for the purpose of organ donation, challenging the ethical boundaries of cloning.</p>
