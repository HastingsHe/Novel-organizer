          <li><strong>Hailsham:</strong>  
            - **Description**: A prestigious boarding school hidden in the English countryside, dedicated to nurturing creativity among its clone students. It isolates the students from the broader world and conceals their purpose. (Page 45)  
            - **Symbolism**: Represents society’s attempts to morally justify exploitation by cloaking it in education and care. The serenity of Hailsham masks its dark purpose, reflecting society’s ability to hide ethical conflicts behind a façade of normalcy.

            - **Symbolism**: Highlights the dehumanizing commodification of the clones, reducing them to biological resources.  
            - **Significance in Narrative**: These centers serve as the grim culmination of the clones’ purpose, contrasting sharply with Hailsham’s idyllic setting.  
          </li>
          <li><strong>The Norfolk Beaches:</strong>  
            - **Description**: A symbolic setting where Kathy and Tommy confront the harsh truths of their existence. (Pages 230, 250)
