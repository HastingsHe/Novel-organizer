                <h2 class="collapsible-header">Setting</h2>
                <div class="collapsible-content">
                    <p><strong>Key Locations:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Hailsham:</strong> A seemingly idyllic boarding school where students are trained to be organ donors. The setting represents a controlled and limited world that students, including Kathy, are unaware of until later. It symbolizes innocence, manipulation, and restricted freedom.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Cottages:</strong> A farmhouse-like setting where the students from Hailsham live after graduation. It represents a transition from childhood to adulthood and the inevitability of their fate. The Cottages mark the beginning of the characters’ confrontation with reality.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Pond:</strong> A recurring symbol in the novel that represents both hope and confinement. It is a place where characters, especially Kathy, try to escape the harsh realities of their lives, yet they remain tethered to their fate.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Each setting plays a crucial role in reinforcing the themes of control, identity, and mortality. The confinement and isolation of these spaces create a sense of claustrophobia that reflects the characters' lives.</p>
                    <div class="quote">
                        <p><strong>Quote:</strong> “Hailsham was a place of control and subtle manipulation.”</p>

                        <p><strong>Key Traits:</strong> Reflective, caring, and loyal. Kathy serves as the narrator, and her introspective nature shapes the tone of the novel. She is also emotionally burdened by her role as a caretaker, making her an unreliable yet empathetic narrator.</p>

                        <p><strong>Important Moments:</strong> Kathy’s reflection on her past and her relationship with Tommy and Ruth, particularly the emotional climax when she realizes the truth about their lives.</p>
                        <div class="quote">
                            <p><strong>Quote:</strong> “I keep thinking about Hailsham, and how it was a place where all of us were destined for one purpose.”</p>

                        <p><strong>Relationships:</strong> Tommy’s complicated relationships with Kathy and Ruth are marked by a sense of unfulfilled desire and confusion.</p>
                        <p><strong>Important Moments:</strong> Tommy’s outbursts and his eventual acceptance of his fate. One pivotal moment is his rage at the notion that their lives are meant to serve others.</p>

                    <h3>Memory</h3>
                    <p>The theme of memory is central to the novel. The characters constantly look back at their past, trying to make sense of their lives and their purpose. Memory allows Kathy to both protect herself and attempt to rewrite her personal history.</p>
                    <h3>Identity</h3>
                    <p>The question of identity is explored through the characters' awareness of their purpose and the existential dilemma it creates. Kathy, Tommy, and Ruth all struggle with understanding who they are beyond their roles as organ donors.</p>
                    <h3>Mortality</h3>
                    <p>The inevitability of death looms over the characters. Their mortality is predetermined, and this creates a sense of tragic futility in their lives. The novel explores how they come to terms with their limited time.</p>
