        <ul>
          <li><strong>Hailsham:</strong> The boarding school where Kathy, Tommy, Ruth, and other clones are raised. It is a place of both apparent nurturing and control. It stands as a metaphor for innocence, manipulation, and the controlled lives of the students. (Page 45)</li>

      <section id="symbols">
        <h2>Symbols</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>The Art:</strong> The art created by the clones is a symbol of their inner lives and their understanding of their existence. Despite being told it is valuable, it is ultimately used as a means of validation for their purpose.Artwork is highly valued at Hailsham, possibly symbolizing the children's pursuit of individuality and self-expression.</li>
          <li><strong>The "Gallery":</strong> The gallery symbolizes art and personal expression. To make the students feel better about their art being taken away, Miss Emily emphasizes how wonderful it is to be chosen for the gallery. This is significant because art is a form of currency at Hailsham, and providing a piece for the gallery means the student will have fewer works to trade at the exchange.</li>
          <li><strong>The "Money":</strong> Money in the story symbolizes the desire for freedom and choice. The children's pursuit of money reflects their longing to control their own destinies.</li>
          <li><strong>The "Donor" Program:</strong> Donations represent the children's ultimate fate, symbolizing sacrifice and selflessness, while also reflecting the brevity and剥夺 ("deprived" in English, which seems to be a translation error; it should be "transience" or "futility") of their lives and the future that has been taken from them.</li>
        </ul>
