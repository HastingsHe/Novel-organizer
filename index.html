                <h2 class="collapsible-header">Setting</h2>
                <div class="collapsible-content">
                    <p><strong>Key Locations:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Hailsham:</strong> A seemingly idyllic boarding school where students are trained to be organ donors. The setting represents a controlled and limited world that students, including Kathy, are unaware of until later. It symbolizes innocence, manipulation, and restricted freedom.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Cottages:</strong> A farmhouse-like setting where the students from Hailsham live after graduation. It represents a transition from childhood to adulthood and the inevitability of their fate. The Cottages mark the beginning of the characters’ confrontation with reality.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Pond:</strong> A recurring symbol in the novel that represents both hope and confinement. It is a place where characters, especially Kathy, try to escape the harsh realities of their lives, yet they remain tethered to their fate.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Significance:</strong> Each setting plays a crucial role in reinforcing the themes of control, identity, and mortality. The confinement and isolation of these spaces create a sense of claustrophobia that reflects the characters' lives.</p>
                    <div class="quote">
                        <p><strong>Quote:</strong> “Hailsham was a place of control and subtle manipulation.”</p>
