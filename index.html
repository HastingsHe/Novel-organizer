                <h3>Memory</h3>
                <p>Memory plays a central role in the characters’ lives and shapes their identity. The act of remembering provides a sense of agency in a world where they have little control.</p>

                <p>The characters struggle to define themselves against the backdrop of their predetermined fate as organ donors. Their quest for meaning and individuality drives much of the novel.</p>
                <h3>Mortality</h3>
                <p>The inevitability of death, especially for the clones, underpins the novel’s tension and emotional depth.</p>
                <div class="questions">
                    <p><strong>Question:</strong> How do the characters’ memories influence their decisions and relationships?</p>
