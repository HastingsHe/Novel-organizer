            <h2>Setting</h2>
            <div class="setting-detail" data-keywords="hailsham pond cottages lunch queue">
                <p><strong>Hailsham:</strong> Hailsham is an isolated, idyllic boarding school for children, offering a unique education in art, literature, and humanities. However, as the novel progresses, it becomes clear that the school's primary function is to nurture the students for a singular purpose: to eventually donate their organs. The atmosphere at Hailsham is controlled, and many of the students, especially Kathy, Ruth, and Tommy, slowly come to terms with the disquieting truth of their futures. The setting is symbolic of the way the students' lives are carefully curated. (Page 5, 8)</p>
            </div>
            <div class="setting-detail" data-keywords="pond">
                <p><strong>The Pond:</strong> The pond near Hailsham is a significant symbol throughout the novel, representing a fleeting sense of freedom and escape for the characters. It’s the place where Kathy and Ruth share one of their most vulnerable conversations about their future and the uncertain nature of their relationships. The pond's stillness represents their desire for peace amidst their otherwise chaotic and predetermined lives. (Page 112, 160)</p>
            </div>
            <div class="setting-detail" data-keywords="cottages">
                <p><strong>The Cottages:</strong> After leaving Hailsham, the characters move to the Cottages, an isolated rural area. The setting here provides a glimpse into the outside world, where the characters begin to explore more adult relationships, often marked by uncertainty and confusion. The contrast between the controlled life at Hailsham and the more free-form existence at the Cottages highlights the realization that there is little room for individual choice in their lives. (Page 98, 140)</p>

            <div class="setting-detail" data-keywords="lunch queue">
                <p><strong>The Lunch Queue:</strong> The lunch queue at Hailsham serves as a metaphor for the orderly control of their lives. It’s a small but powerful reminder of how their routine is structured by the school’s rules. The characters are always aware of their place in line, both literally and metaphorically, reflecting their subjugation to a system that treats them as less than human. (Page 25, 45)</p>

She cares deeply for the children and becomes a mentor to Kathy, Ruth, and Tommy. However, her outspokenness about their future causes tension, as the school administration seeks to maintain the illusion that the students have some control over their lives.

            <div class="theme-detail" data-keywords="mortality fate">
                <p><strong>Mortality and Fate:</strong> One of the most profound themes is the inescapable nature of the students' fate—they are created to donate their organs and ultimately die young. The characters come to terms with this reality in different ways. For Kathy, Tommy, and Ruth, their understanding of mortality becomes intertwined with their quest for meaning in their relationships. Their struggles with this truth reflect the universal human fear of impending death. (Page 100, 170)</p>

            <div class="theme-detail" data-keywords="ethics of science">
                <p><strong>Ethics of Science:</strong> The novel questions the ethics of the scientific system that creates clones for organ harvesting. The characters' awareness of their role as organ donors is gradually revealed, raising important moral questions. Miss Lucy’s rebellion against this system and Miss Emily’s justification of it underscore the moral divide in the novel. The characters' lack of choice and control is a tragic commentary on the human cost of scientific progress. (Page 60, 120)</p>

Their works of art are a symbol of their struggle for identity and meaning in a world that limits their choices. Art is a form of self-expression for the students, but it is also used by Hailsham as a way to prove their worth. The characters' relationship with their art reflects their evolving understanding of their fate and their desire to create something that transcends their predetermined roles. (Page 40, 85)</p>
            </div>
