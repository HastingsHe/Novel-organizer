            <h3>Hailsham</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Description:</strong> Hailsham is an English boarding school that appears idyllic, yet it is designed to raise clones for organ donation. Nestled in a pastoral countryside, its serene exterior masks a grim reality. This controlled setting mirrors how society cloaks uncomfortable truths behind a façade of normalcy. (<em>Ishiguro, p. 10</em>)
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Symbolism:</strong> Represents society’s attempt to morally justify exploitation by disguising it as care and education.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Significance in Narrative:</strong> In Parts I and II, Hailsham conditions the students for their predetermined roles. In Part III, however, Hailsham’s legacy is reexamined as the final revelations strip away the illusions, emphasizing the irrevocable loss of innocence.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>The Woods:</strong> Boundaries and the fear of the unknown; in Part III, they also underscore the irreversible limits of the characters’ lives. (<em>p. 45</em>)</li>
              <li><strong>The Pond:</strong> A place of quiet reflection; by Part III, it becomes a symbol of the fading hope that once animated the students’ memories. (<em>p. 35</em>)</li>
              <li><strong>The Art Room:</strong> Central to expressing creativity and humanity, its significance deepens in the final chapters as art is revealed to be a desperate assertion of identity. (<em>p. 20</em>)</li>

            <h3>The Cottages & Recovery Centers</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Description:</strong> After Hailsham, the shift to the cottages marks the characters’ transition from sheltered ignorance to the stark realities of life. In Part III, this setting evolves further as recovery centers replace any semblance of hope with sterile inevitability.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Symbolism:</strong> The cottages illustrate the decay of innocence, while the recovery centers in Part III highlight the ultimate dehumanization of the clones.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Significance in Narrative:</strong> While the earlier sections show a gradual loss of autonomy, Part III confronts the characters—and the reader—with the finality of their fate.
              (<em>Ishiguro, p. 201; p. 190, 220</em>)
