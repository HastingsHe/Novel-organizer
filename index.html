            <h3>Hailsham</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>Description:</strong> Hailsham is an English boarding school that appears idyllic, yet it is designed to raise clones for organ donation. Nestled in a pastoral countryside, its serene exterior masks a grim reality. This controlled setting mirrors how society cloaks uncomfortable truths behind a façade of normalcy. (<em>Ishiguro, p. 10</em>)
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Symbolism:</strong> Represents society’s attempt to morally justify exploitation by disguising it as care and education.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Significance in Narrative:</strong> In Parts I and II, Hailsham conditions the students for their predetermined roles. In Part III, however, Hailsham’s legacy is reexamined as the final revelations strip away the illusions, emphasizing the irrevocable loss of innocence.

            <p>
              <strong>Description:</strong> After Hailsham, the shift to the cottages marks the characters’ transition from sheltered ignorance to the stark realities of life. In Part III, this setting evolves further as recovery centers replace any semblance of hope with sterile inevitability.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Symbolism:</strong> The cottages illustrate the decay of innocence, while the recovery centers in Part III highlight the ultimate dehumanization of the clones.
