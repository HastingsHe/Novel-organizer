        <h2>Themes</h2>
        <p><strong>Memory:</strong> Memory plays a central role in Kathy's storytelling, as she revisits her past experiences. The unreliable nature of memory is explored, particularly through Kathy’s reflections on events that shaped her understanding of her life. (Page 67)</p>
        <p><strong>Identity:</strong> The characters constantly struggle to define who they are in a world where their identities are shaped by others. The theme of identity is strongly linked to their fate as clones, and their sense of self evolves throughout the novel. (Page 150)</p>
        <p><strong>Ethics of Science:</strong> The novel questions the ethics behind cloning and organ donation. The clones’ awareness of their purpose challenges societal views on morality and the sanctity of life. (Page 85)</p>
        <p><strong>Mortality:</strong> The inevitability of death is a persistent theme. The characters’ knowledge of their fates forces them to reckon with their mortality at an early age, driving much of the emotional and psychological conflict in the novel. (Page 210)</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Key Quote:</strong> "The problem, as I see it, is that we only ever really think about death when it’s right in front of us." (Page 150)</li>

      <section id="symbols">
        <h2>Symbols and Motifs</h2>
        <p><strong>The Artwork:</strong> The artwork produced by the students at Hailsham is a key symbol in the novel. It represents the characters' attempts to create something meaningful in a world that dictates their purpose. The art serves as a form of self-expression, but also as a method of manipulation, with Madame collecting the works to further the illusion that the clones’ lives have value. (Page 88)</p>
        <p><strong>The Tape:</strong> The tape is a recurring symbol for Kathy, representing her need to preserve memories and a connection to the past. It’s a tool for her reflection, but also a sign of her detachment from the present. (Page 143)</p>
        <p><strong>The Boat:</strong> The boat symbolizes freedom and escape for Kathy, Tommy, and Ruth. The idea of taking the boat to the horizon suggests an unreachable desire to break free from their predetermined lives. It’s a representation of lost dreams and unfulfilled wishes. (Page 192)</p>
        <p><strong>The Garden:</strong> The garden at Hailsham reflects the idea of growth and potential, yet it is also a controlled, manicured space, much like the lives of the clones. It represents the false hope of a life with autonomy. (Page 45)</p>
